# Aldi the Explorer - Train your own Transformer workshop

Aldan Creo

We'll train our own Decoder-Only Transformer from scratch, based on the original GPT paper. The goal is to understand how the model works, and how to train it. We'll use PyTorch for the training loop, and Hugging Face's Datasets for the data loading.
