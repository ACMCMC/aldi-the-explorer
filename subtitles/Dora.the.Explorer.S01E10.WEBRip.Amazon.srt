00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19.395
We can't go through it.

187
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22.950
Both:
How can we get across it?

188
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25.228
Let's stop and think.

189
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27.921
Do you see something
that can help us

190
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29.888
across the
Icy Cold River?

Lifejackets!

195
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45.041
So we can be safe.

196
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:54.637
Will you help us row
across the Icy Cold River?

197
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58.572
You will? Great!

198
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:03.612
Put your hands out in front
of you and row, row, row!

199

Both:
Row, row, row!

203
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:17.349
We made it across
the Icy Cold River.

204
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:19.628
Good rowing.

205
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:23.355
Dora, I can't wait to
eat those blueberries.

206
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:26.117
I can't wait, either.

207
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:29.914
Blueberries are so
sweet and juicy.

208
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:33.193
Both:
Mmm, yummy!

209
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35.885
Where do we go next?

Will you help us swing
over the prickers and thorns?

very quiet.

Why?

359
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34.407
We don't want Swiper
to hear us.
